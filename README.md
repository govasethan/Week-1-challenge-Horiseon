# Week-1-challenge
in this challenge i went in and changed the htmal to more simplier and more structuably accessible to all puttingt alt 
tags in the img source to describe it better, for programs like google read and write
i replaced some div tags with header, footer, section because theyre are way better and more suitable ways to achieve the same thing as a div
the site still maintained its correct display with a change one less code and lines 
tried to compile the css so i can have multiple things together who have the same lines as code but had trouble with that,
